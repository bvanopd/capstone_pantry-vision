# pantry-vision

This is the repository for Pantry Vision, an application that helps you manage your pantry. It is in its proof of concept stage, and is currently only set up to validate the technology stack. It is the capstone project for the three developers [bvanopd](https://github.com/bvanopd), [bojerg](https://github.com/bojerg), and [MorganKruger](https://github.com/MorganKruger). The project is composed of an Angular front end application supported by a Spring Boot back end, which is connected to a MYSQL database.

Pantry Vision is a web application which tracks users' available ingredients in order to suggest recipes, common missing ingredients which they might consider picking up on their next grocery trip, and insights into ways they could enrich their familiesâ€™ nutrition based on the ingredients they typically have at hand. The best part about showing users which ingredients they might consider buying is that, in turn, we can show them what exciting new recipes they could be making! We can provide a pragmatic way to build grocery lists which both enhance nutrition and inspire delicious, unique family meals.

## Installation

### Dependency set up
To set up the project, you will need the following:
- A MySQL database server (8.0 or higher)
- Java JDK-17
- Apache Maven 3.9.5
- Node.js 20.9.0

After these tools have been installed, make sure they are added to your Path environment variables (User)

> Additionally, you may consider intalling the Angular CLI (v16.2) globally to aid in development

### Create a local Repository
- Fork this repo
- Clone your forked repo

### Set up the local database
- Access your local MySQL server, either through a terminal or a tool like MYSQL Workbench
- Create the Pantry Vision database ```CREATE DATABASE pantry_db;```
- NOTE the back end data connection is set up to connect to mysql with the user 'root' and a password of 'password', if this is not your setup, either change the root password or edit the application.properties and application-dev.properties files in the Spring Boot project. **TODO add these to gitignore?**
- NOTE Make sure your MYSQL80 service is running. Sometimes this can fail to start up on system restart.

### Start up the back end
- Navigate to the */backend/pantryVision-core/* directory and run ```mvn clean install```
- Run the Spring Boot application by running the *PantryVisionCoreApplication.java* file. If you're using IntelliJ it probably made a run configuration for this and you can just click the green start button. Otherwise it can be run with ```java -jar target/pantryVision-core-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```

    > If you you run with the ```java -jar``` command, the jar is a snapshot of the application we created with ```mvn clean install```

- The back end should be running at this point. Check the terminal for errors.
- The back end listens on localhost:8080, you can verify it's running by hitting an endpoint in your browser: ```http://localhost:8080/api/users/listAll.do```

### Start up the front end
- Navigate to the */frontend/pantryVision/* directory and ensure front end dependencies are installed by running ```npm install```
- Start the front end by running ```npm start```
  - The ```npm start``` script is configured to fire up a local development server for Angular with a proxy to allow cross-origin resource sharing. Essentially it redirects HTTP requests to trick Angular into thinking it's on the same domain as the back end.
- The application should be running now at ```http://localhost:4200/```
